# Contributing to this project
* To contribute to this project first and foremost you should join [this discord](https://discord.gg/9Yh7cWZ). After joining use the #chose-a-role channel to give yourself the roles you wish and in time an admin will give you the relevant roles to give you access to the development section.
* Next Fork this repository so you have your own instance in your own personal space.
* *If you want to create a local version on your pc then clone the master branch of your own fork at this point".
* Create a new branch with the name: "issue-issue_number", replacing issue_number with the issue number you're resolving. For example if I was creating a branch for the issue with number "#5" and name "This is an issue" my branch would be named "This is an issue - #5".
* Make your changes to this branch(see below) and commit your changes often with concise but descriptive commit messages referencing the issue("fix #5 add strip movement functionality")
* **As far as the actual changes go. Please refer to this guide for documenting and structuring the code.** *(This guide is still to be added. Once I've actually started implementing and I(Adam) have found a good code convention to follow I'll create a guide.)*
* Add your changes to ChangelogInitial.md [Which can be found in: .github/ChangelogInitial.md](https://github.com/JonathanFerguson1/Strips/blob/master/.github/ChangelogInitial.md). These changes will be checked and added to CHANGELOG.md as required before any release.
* *Push the commits to your fork if you are on a desktop version*
* Submit a pull request comparing the branch you have made the changes to with the main master branch(on the main repository).
* Use 1 pull request per issue. This makes it easier to review and keeps everything tidy on the project board.

Thanks for showing interest and help with the development. Any questions then ask in the DEVELOPERS section of the discord.

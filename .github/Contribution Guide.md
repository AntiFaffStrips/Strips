# Contributing to this project
* To contribute to this project first and foremost you should join [this discord](https://discord.gg/9Yh7cWZ). After joining use the #chose-a-role channel to give yourself the roles you wish and in time an admin will give you the relevant roles to give you access to the development section.
* Next, fork this repository so you have your own instance in your own personal space.
* This is done by clicking the Fork button on the top right of the [main repository](https://imgur.com/a/w1I0JiQ)
* *If you want to create a local version on your pc then clone the master branch of your own fork at this point". This is recommended to be done inside the GitHub desktop client.
* Create a new branch with the name: "issue-#issue_number", replacing issue_number with the issue number you're resolving. For example if I was creating a branch for the issue with number "5" and name "This is an issue" my branch would be named "This is an issue - #5". 
* Make your changes to this branch(see below) and commit your changes often with concise but descriptive commit messages referencing the issue("fix #5 add strip movement functionality")
* **As far as the actual changes go. Please refer to this guide for documenting and structuring the code.** 
* Firstly make sure that your master branch is the same version and is uptodate with the master branch of the main repo 
* Once your changed have been commited to your master branch in your fork. Make a pull request that compares your branch for the issue with the master branch of the main repo. This should mean 1 pull request per issue. And make the request at the beginning so we can see every commit made.
* Make your changes following the structure and documentation guide.
* When commiting your changed make it in line with your saving or when you add an important thing, using a good naming convention.
* Push your commits to your own fork, at least once a day.
* Make sure that you test any changes you have made and if needed add screenshots of the working version to the pull request.
* Once finished request a review of the pull request, if able ask the person who made the original issue.
* If further changes are requested don't be disheartened this is normal is software development.
* Once these have been done request another review.
* Once both parties are happy the changes the pull request will get the testing label


Thanks for showing interest and help with the development. Any questions then ask in the DEVELOPERS section of the discord.
